### **Summary**

Hi! I'm a second year undergraduate Math/CS major at the University of California, San Diego. I plan to pursue an MS in Computer Science after I graduate, and then a position in industry as a software engineer. But, as Bush said,

> Well, I think if you say youâ€™re going to do something and donâ€™t do it, thatâ€™s trustworthiness. *(Aug. 30, 2000)*

This Summer, I am going to be working as an SWE Intern at Walmart Global Tech in Bentonville, AR.
